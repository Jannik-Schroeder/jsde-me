## Security and Privacy

### Why there are so many Security Features?

We offer our users the possibility to make the security according to their wishes.
E2E and password is of course the highest level of security we offer.
You may ask yourself why there are "insecure" functions that are not 100% secure.
But we have thought.
Since the link to E2E is the key to decrypt the file in the URL is included, you can not simply enter them by heart.
So it should be possible to use our system also as url shortener.
For this you have our word that we will not read your data.

### How secure is our System?

As an Outsider, it is impossible to connect to our server. For security reasons, we will not go into further security.
But we can assure you that we have thought of everything and that our system is secure. And only Intern Accessible.

## Conclusion

### What is the goal of this project?

The goal of this project is to provide a secure and privacy-friendly alternative to Other Sharing Services.
We want to offer our users the possibility to share files with other people without having to worry about their privacy.

### Current status of the project

The project is currently in the beta phase.
The Main Features are implemented and the project is ready for use.
We are currently working on the Webmail Client, but this is not yet ready for use.
At the Services you will find the current status of the Service likes if it is ready for use or not.

## Future plans

You can already log in and create an account.
However, you can not use the webmail function.
You can use your mail without automatic E2E encryption.
In the future when we have collected a few users.
We want to offer a few premium features, like more storage and no Rate Limit.
We also want a Desktop Client for Windows, Linux and macOS.
There is no plan for mobile apps at the moment.
However, webmail will become responsive like all other services.
In the future, of course, we also want to grow globally and offer servers in America and other regions of the world.
However, since we are currently not making any sales with this project, we only offer location in Germany.
