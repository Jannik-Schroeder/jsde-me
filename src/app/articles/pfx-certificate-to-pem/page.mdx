## Converting a Windows PFX Certificate to PEM for Linux

In my recent experience upgrading my home network infrastructure, I encountered a challenge that many system administrators might find familiar: I had a Windows PFX certificate but needed to use it in a Linux environment. Specifically, I wanted to use it with an NGINX web server, which requires PEM-formatted certificates.

After some research and testing, I found a straightforward method to convert the PFX certificate into the necessary PEM format. Here’s how I did it:

### Step 1: Extracting the Private Key from the PFX File

The first step involves extracting the private key from the PFX file. This is done while keeping the key protected with a password:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in windowszertifikat.pfx -nocerts -out linux.pem
```

This command extracts the private key and saves it to a file named `linux.pem`.

### Step 2: Extracting the Certificate from the PFX File

Next, I extracted the actual certificate from the PFX file:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in windowszertifikat.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out linuxzertifikat.pem
```

This command outputs the certificate into a file named `linuxzertifikat.pem`.

### Step 3: Removing the Password from the Private Key

To make the private key easier to use, I removed the password protection:

```bash
openssl rsa -in linux.pem -out linux.key
```

This command creates a password-free private key file named `linux.key`.

### Using the Converted Certificate in NGINX

With the conversion complete, I was able to configure my NGINX server to use the new PEM-formatted certificate and key:

```bash
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/linuxzertifikat.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/linux.key;
```

### Conclusion

This process made it possible to utilize the Windows PFX certificate in my Linux environment, ensuring secure communications for my newly upgraded network. I hope this guide helps others who might face a similar challenge.

Thank you for reading, and if you found this guide helpful, my family and I would greatly appreciate your support (donations are properly taxed!).
