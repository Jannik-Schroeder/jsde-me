# SPWHub Introduction

## What is SPWHub?

SPWHub is a alliance of entrepreneurs, who are building a decentralized network. The network is built on top of Kubernetes and is fail-safe. At the moment, we're just having ideas and Brainstorming.

## What is the goal of SPWHub?

The goal of SPWHub is to build a decentralized network, which is fail-safe and we can rent out our resources to other people. We're also building a decentralized marketplace, where people can buy and sell their resources.

## What is the current status of SPWHub?

At the moment, we're just having ideas and Brainstorming. We're also building a website, where we can share our ideas and Brainstorming.
