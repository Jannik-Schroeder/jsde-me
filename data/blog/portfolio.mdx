## What is this Website?

This Website is a portfolio of my work. It is a NextJS website hosted on my Homelab. It is a responsive website that works on all devices fully coded in typescript and tailwindcss.

## Why This Project?

This project was born out of my intense desire to expand my frontend skills. I recognized the importance of mastering modern web technologies to be more effective in my role, especially for our projects at Solun Services. The IT industry is constantly evolving, and to stay ahead, it's crucial to continuously learn and adapt.

NextJS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS are leading technologies in the field of web development, and proficiency in these tools is now highly sought after. Through the development of this portfolio website, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in these technologies, gaining a deep understanding of their capabilities and nuances.

This learning journey was not just about coding a responsive website, but about building something meaningful and robust that could withstand real-world usage across a multitude of devices. It was about pushing boundaries, solving problems, and creating an exceptional user experience.

The knowledge and experience gained from this project have significantly improved my ability to contribute to Solun Services. I'm now better equipped to handle the complexities of frontend development and can bring more innovative solutions to the table. This means our team can deliver higher quality services, meeting the demands of our clients more effectively.

In essence, this project was not just a demonstration of my skillset, but a stepping stone towards my goal of becoming a more competent and versatile frontend developer. It's a testament to my commitment to professional growth and dedication to delivering excellence in every project I undertake.
